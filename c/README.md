C is a simple and tiny scientific RPN-Calculator. It tries to minimizethe necessary keystrokes.

Note that changing sign could be done by pressing SPACE.

One nice 'non-scientific' feature is the calculation of annuities ... 8% in 5 years equals 3.99 (.08 ENTER 5a).

Get some further help by pressing 'h' after starting the program.

Compile with:

```
gcc -Wall -s -O3 c.c -lm
```

Download: C 0.1 (1k9)

Feel free to improve this program under the conditions of the general GNU-license-agreement.
