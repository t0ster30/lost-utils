Textdraw (td) is a small utility that allows do draw (ascii-based) line-,
rectangle-, ellipse- and text-objects with copy/paste/move features.

For me it completes existing console-based software to a 'textbased only
office' and offers a simple and easy way to draw ascii graphics for
documentations, presentations, mails and much more.

Read the attached file 'help.txt' to see what's possible and how textdraw
works. See also the help page of the program (key: 'h').

For compiling from source (td.c) you have to link ncurses and math - do it
with the command: gcc td.c -lncurses -lm

There are a lot of ideas for a newer version (i.e. colors, patterns,
group/rotate/mirror objects, polygons, ascii-art-import) and the actual
version seems to be stable (under 'normal use'). But as it fullfills all
I need I don't intend to program a newer version.

Feel free to improve this program under the conditions of the general
GNU-license-agreement.
