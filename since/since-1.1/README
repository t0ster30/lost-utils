Since
-----

since is a tail(1) with state - it allows the user to
view only the lines appended to a file since the last
time since was used.

Installation
------------

To build the executable type:

    make

To install the executable and manual page, become root and type:

    make install

The default locations are:

    /usr/local/bin/since
    /usr/local/share/man/man1/since.1

To change the install location use the prefix variable:

  make prefix=/usr install

Use
---

To understand how since works run the following commands:
  
    make
    echo "First line" >> testlogfile
    ./since testlogfile
    echo "Second line" >> testlogfile
    ./since testlogfile
    rm testlogfile

I find it useful to add aliases such as the following to my
.bashrc file

    alias dosince='since /var/log/{messages,syslog,mail.log}'
